# Blue-Signal
Aoi Project
📁 Project Overview

This project started as a class assignment, but once I began working on it, I realized how much I actually enjoyed it. What was supposed to be just a simple task turned into something much more personal  a place where I could bring together my skills and interests.

From the very beginning, I cared about both the structure and the look  I wanted the site to not only work properly but also feel engaging and unique.

Throughout the process, I explored CSS in more depth and learned how small visual tweaks can make a big difference. I also understood how important it is to plan before diving into the design.

✨ Theme / Inspiration

I’m really into anime and video games, so I drew inspiration from those worlds. At first, I wanted to go for a pixel-art style, but it didn’t quite fit the overall look. Eventually, I decided to base the visual direction on a character I designed myself.

🎨 Design Decisions

I initially planned to use shades of blue because of my name, Aoi, but ended up following the color palette of the character instead.

The final theme turned out to be mostly dark, to better match the atmosphere of the design.

I focused on keeping everything simple but visually consistent from fonts to colors to layout.

🧠 Challenges


Each part of the site had its own set of difficulties from choosing the right color combinations, to matching the design of the character with the overall layout. But with persistence and trial-and-error, I managed to solve every problem step by step.
